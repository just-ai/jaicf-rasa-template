# JAICF+Rasa project template

Here is a ready to use [JAICF](https://framework.just-ai.com) bot template _written in Kotlin_ that utilises a [Rasa](https://rasa.com) NLU service and can be deployed to Heroku cloud with a single click.
You can use this project as a templated JAICF-based project with Rasa NLU engine.

## How to use

You can deploy this template right on [Heroku](https://heroku.com) cloud and then modify and debug it locally on your PC.

### 1. Deploy Rasa server

Once this project utilises a Rasa NLU, you have firstly to deploy a Rasa server to the Heroku cloud.
Here is a [ready to use template](https://github.com/just-ai/rasa-heroku-template), that can be deployed to Heroku with a single click.

_Once deployed, copy the server's URL for the next step._

### 2. Create a Telegram bot

This project is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chatbot, thus you have to [create a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) and obtain it's token.

_JAICF is a [multi-platform framework](https://github.com/just-ai/jaicf-kotlin/wiki/Channels#multi-channel-support), thus this project can be connected to any channel, not only a Telegram._

### 3. Deploy to Heroku

Once you've deployed Rasa NLU and created Telegram bot, you can deploy this project to Heroku cloud.
Just click on the button below.
